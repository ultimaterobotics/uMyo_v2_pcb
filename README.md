# PCB for uMyo (v2)

This is a KiCAD 6 project for the first produced batch of uMyo devices. There are some things worth improving, but overall it works as intended.

PCB is licensed under CERN-OHL-P-2.0 - we use MIT license for our software/firmware projects, but it seems that for hardware it doesn't work well, so we applied this option. In our understanding, it should permit anyone to use this design as a whole or incorporate its parts into other projects with no restrictions (including commercial use), except for claiming that it was not derived from our project. If you want to use it but something in this license prevents you from doing that - please contact us, we'll see what can be done about it.
